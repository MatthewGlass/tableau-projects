# Tableau Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my Tableau Projects Portfolio!  
This repository highlights a collection of interactive dashboards and data analyses created using **Tableau**.  
Each project demonstrates my ability to transform raw data into actionable insights through intuitive visualization design, dynamic filtering, and KPI-driven storytelling.  
All dashboards are published on **Tableau Public** and can be explored interactively through the links below.
